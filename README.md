<h1>CIT Algoritmic Cell</h1>

<br/>

<p>First and foremost, allow me to introduce myself. I am the Algortihmic cell chief at CIT. Currently, I am in my second year of study in Software Engineering at the National Institute of Posts and Telecommunications (INPT).</p>

<br/>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>You might be wondering what we do at Algorithmic Cell. Our main goal is to share Algorithmic thinking with the cell members.</p>

<br/>

<h2>What's Algorithmic thinking</h2>
<p>It is a method of solving by clearly defining the procedures required. Instead of coming up with a single solution to a problem, students create algorithms. When followed precisely (by a person or a computer), they are instructions or rules that lead to solutions to the original and related problems. <br /> Briefly, to have an algorithmic thinking is to have the ability to create blueprints for others to implement on their own. Now that we talked about algortihmic thinking </p>

<h2>What's an algorithm</h2>
<p>Instead of a standard definition, I'm going to give a quote about algorithms. No human being can write fast enough, long enough, or small enough ("smaller and smaller without limit... you'd be writing on molecules, atoms, and electrons"). to list all members of an enumerably infinite set by writing out their names in some notation one after the other But, in the case of certain enumerably infinite sets, humans can do something equally useful: They can provide explicit instructions for determining the nth member of a finite set. Such instructions must be given explicitly, in a format that a computing machine or a human capable of carrying out only the most basic operations on symbols can understand. To put it another way, to represent a continuous world on a discrete machine, we use a set of small instructions that, when combined, can solve all sets of problems. for further explanation i highly recommend checking this wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm</p>
